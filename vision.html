      <h3>The Concept of Dedicated Recycling Facilities</h3>
      <p>Dedicated recycling facilities for hospitals and universities aim to provide tailored solutions for managing plastic waste efficiently. These facilities would incorporate specialized equipment and processes designed to handle the diverse types of plastic waste generated within these institutions. By centralizing the recycling process, these facilities offer a more streamlined and sustainable approach to waste management, reducing the environmental impact of plastic consumption.</p>
