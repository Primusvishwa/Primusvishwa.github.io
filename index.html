      <h3>How does plastic affect us economically?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Increased costs of waste management - every year it costs more than US $32 billion, to collect, sort, dispose and recycle the huge quantities of plastic waste generated.</li>
        <li>Governments, NGOs and concerned citizens incur significant costs from undertaking clean-up activities to remove the waste, as high as US$15 billion per year.</li>
        <li>Marine plastic pollution can create huge economic costs in the form of gross domestic product (GDP) reductions, estimated at up to US$7 billion for 2018 alone. This is driven by the loss in revenue from tourism, fishing, aquaculture and others.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Impact of Plastic Waste in Hospitals</h3>
      <p>Single-use plastic is often hospitalsâ€™ best, most sterile option for healthcare tools and personal protective equipment (PPE). Additionally, plastic is cost-effective, durable, and easy to dispose of.</p>
      <p>Hospitals generate a significant amount of plastic waste, estimated to be between 2,800 and 3,500 tons every day. This translates to a staggering annual total of plastic waste from hospitals ranging from 1.02 million to 1.28 million tons. Unfortunately, most of this plastic, around 91%, cannot be recycled or simply isn't recycled, ending up in landfills.</p>

      <h3>Impact of Plastic Waste in Laboratories</h3>
      <p>A major environmental concern has been largely ignored: the impact of disposable lab supplies, especially single-use plastics and protective equipment. This problem has grown worse in recent years, with the pandemic causing a huge surge in the use and disposal of gloves and masks. In fact, some estimates suggest that research in biology, medicine, and agriculture alone generates a shocking 5.5 million tons of plastic waste every year, which is as bad for the environment as the combined carbon footprint of over a million people in the UK.</p>
